## Overview

Selecting an appropriate reasoning method for a given query remains a key challenge in language model generation. In this work, we introduce **EPIC** (Ensemble Planning with Contrastive learning), a framework that learns to match input queries with reasoning methods for better accuracyâ€“cost trade-offs. Experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning tasks show that EPIC consistently selects optimal reasoning methods, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead.
